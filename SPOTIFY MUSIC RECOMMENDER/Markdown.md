# ðŸŽ§ Personal Music Recommender Using Spotify API

As someone who deeply loves music â€” all genres, no discrimination â€” Iâ€™ve always wanted a way to discover new songs tailored to my own taste. So I tried building a simple yet powerful **music recommender** in **Google Colab** using the **Spotify Web API**.

## ðŸš€ What it Does:

- ðŸŽµ **Fetches** my top tracks directly from my Spotify account  
- ðŸ§  **Analyzes** audio features like:
  - *Danceability*
  - *Energy*
  - *Valence* (happiness or sadness)
  - ...and more
- ðŸ¤– **Generates recommendations** using Spotifyâ€™s built-in engine, based on my favorites

Itâ€™s like having a personal DJ who knows exactly what mood Iâ€™m in. ðŸŽ¶

This mini project reminded me just how cool APIs are â€” not only for personalizing experiences, but also for diving deep into **real-world data**.
